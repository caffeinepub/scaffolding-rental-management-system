  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to AuthGuard.tsx and LoginButton.tsx that address authentication error handling and initialization logic. The changes implement improved error state management, ensure the login button is always visible for unauthenticated users (even with errors), and add proper loading states. However, the diff does not include changes to useInternetIdentity.ts where the core initialization improvements should be implemented.",

      "id": "REQ-24",
      "requirement": "Improve the authentication initialization logic in useInternetIdentity.ts to handle edge cases where the auth client may not initialize properly on first load",
      "reason": "No changes to useInternetIdentity.ts are present in the diff, yet this requirement specifically calls for improvements to this file including retry logic with exponential backoff, race condition elimination, and proper state differentiation",

      "requirement": "If Internet Identity initialization fails, a clear error message is shown with a retry button",
      "reason": "AuthGuard.tsx shows a warning message for initialization errors but does not include a retry button as required. The error display lacks retry functionality",
